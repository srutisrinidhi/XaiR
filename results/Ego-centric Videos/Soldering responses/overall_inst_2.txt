1. Adjust the temperature on the soldering station to the appropriate setting for the components you are working with.
2. Unspool solder wire and place a circuit board on a holder in preparation for soldering.
3. Use a soldering iron to desolder components from the circuit board by heating and removing the solder with a desoldering pump.
4. Bend the leads of components with a tool before inserting them onto a prototyping board.
5. Heat up the soldering iron and solder components onto the circuit board by applying heat and solder to create electrical connections.
6. Inspect the soldered connections on the board after finishing soldering the components.
7. Tin the wires of through-hole pin headers with solder before attaching them to the prototyping board using a soldering iron.
8. Secure wire leads onto the prototyping board by applying heat and solder to create connections.
9. Work on soldering or making adjustments to components on a perforated circuit board using a soldering iron.
10. Insert wire components through the holes of the circuit board before flipping it over and soldering the components in place.
