1. Turn on and adjust the temperature of the soldering station to the desired setting.
2. Wait for the soldering iron to heat up to the set temperature.
3. Prepare the electronic components by adjusting, straightening, and positioning them on a perforated circuit board or proto-board.
4. Solder the components by applying solder to the pins of the components on the board.
5. Clean the soldering iron on a sponge as needed.
6. Trim excess leads after soldering components onto the board.
7. Tin the soldering iron tip and create electrical connections by applying solder to the board.
8. Affix wires to the board by preparing them, positioning them correctly, and soldering them to create electrical connections.
9. Continue soldering components onto the board using a soldering iron, attaching leads to designated holes for electrical connections.
10. Repeat the soldering process as needed, adjusting wires and components as necessary.
11. Conduct the soldering tasks for electronics repair or assembly in a well-equipped electronics workspace.
