1. Turn on the Weller soldering station and set the temperature to the desired level (e.g. 323Â°F).
2. Bend the leads of electronic components to fit onto a circuit board.
3. Thread solder wire through the holes of a perfboard.
4. Cut and straighten a length of soldering wire from a spool.
5. Solder electronic components onto the perfboard using a soldering iron.
6. Solder wires onto specific points on the circuit board.
7. Insert pins into the protoboard and solder in place.
8. Solder a wire onto the prototyping PCB.
9. Solder pins onto the prototyping board for connections.
10. Solder a capacitor onto the prototyping board, trimming leads beforehand.
11. Continuously adjust and solder components onto the circuit board.
12. Desolder a component from the circuit board using a soldering iron.
13. Use fume extraction equipment when soldering to remove harmful vapors.
14. Carefully position components on the circuit board and solder in place.
