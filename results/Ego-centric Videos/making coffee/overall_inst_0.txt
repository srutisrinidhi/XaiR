Instructions for making an espresso based on the video segments:
1. Open the lid of the coffee bean hopper on the grinder to refill or check the amount of beans remaining.
2. Start with an empty portafilter, fill it with ground coffee from the grinder, and tamp the grounds in the portafilter.
3. Use the espresso machine to grind coffee beans, distribute and level the ground coffee in the portafilter, and tamp it down to create a compact puck of coffee grounds.
4. Insert the portafilter into the espresso machine and start the espresso extraction process.
5. Monitor the espresso machine's display as the coffee is brewed, ensuring the portafilter is securely in place.
6. Brew the coffee and adjust settings as needed.
7. After brewing the espresso, discard the used coffee grounds and clean the portafilter.
8. Maintain the espresso machine and workspace by tapping and cleaning the portafilter between shots.
9. Dispose of any used paper towels in a trash bin.
10. Enjoy your freshly brewed espresso and consider joining others for a meal in a communal eating area.
